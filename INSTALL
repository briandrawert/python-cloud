This module will work on Pythons 2.6 or 2.7.  Only the standard (cPython) Python interpreter is supported.

To install, run::

  python setup.py install

(You may wish to run sudo python setup.py install if you wish to install cloud for all users.)

Requirements (all users):

Setuptools is required.  If you have pip installed, you already have it.

Debian/ubuntu users, Setuptools can be installed via:
apt-get install python-setuptools

Other operating systems:
Download installer from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools 

Windows users (all versions):
  
  We highly recommend having pywin32 installed before installing PiCloud. Get it at: 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/'
  Due to cwRsync not being present in the source distribution, cloud.volume will 
    not work if you install from source. Please use the binary installer if you need
    cloud.volume.
  

After installing, use the picloud command-line interface (CLI) to set up your machine.  Run 'picloud setup'.
